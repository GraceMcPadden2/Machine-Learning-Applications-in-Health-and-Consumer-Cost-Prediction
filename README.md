This analysis explores the use of supervised machine learning models on two datasets—one concerning diabetes diagnosis, and the other predicting customer acquisition costs. The objective of the analysis is to evaluate and compare the performance of multiple machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Regression, and a Neural Network using Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP). Each dataset required appropriate preprocessing and model tuning, and the results were evaluated using accuracy, R² score, precision, recall, and visualizations. This report summarizes the methods, performance, and takeaways from applying machine learning models to classification and regression problems.
